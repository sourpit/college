# Workshop Algorithms

Not exactly "algorithm", and I can say that I got scammed. On my first day, I'm trully excited to see
what I'm going to learn that day. I've been dreaming how I will become computer wizard among my families.
"This is it, This is the course that will land me to a job", I thought. After 6 Weeks, I didn't see any
topics that is related to algorithm. It just a bunch of tutorials that I could learn from google,
And I'm disapointed.

This folder contained all my miserable past code at Policaltex Riau University.
I learned most of the knowledge from Beej's guide and Books that I got from online archive.
